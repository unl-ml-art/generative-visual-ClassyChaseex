# Project 3 Generative Visual

Karston Chase, kchase4@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

My idea is for a user to input text that describes a room in their house. This would describe things such as wall color, furniture color, accent colors, artificial or natural lighting, etc. Then this description would be translated into keywords for BigGAN to then turn into a painting or artwork that would compliment said room if hung up on the wall. Whether a picture of a landscape or an abstract painting, BigGAN will create an image that brings out the best of your interior space. Do you have a room with boring, blank walls? Have no fear, BigGAN is here! GAN you believe finding artwork could be so easy?

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
